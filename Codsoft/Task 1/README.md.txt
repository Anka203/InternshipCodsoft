 Task 1: Number Guessing Game

This is a simple and fun number-guessing game. The computer picks a random number, and your job is to guess it. Along the way, the program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct. Sounds simple, right? But there’s more to it.

Cool Features:-

Random Number: The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
Guessing Game: You type your guesses, and the game helps you get closer.
Limited Attempts: You can’t guess forever—there’s a limit.
Multiple Rounds: Want to play again? Sure, why not!
Scorekeeping: The game tracks your performance—fewer guesses mean a better score.
How It Works
The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
You enter your guesses, one at a time.
The game gives you hints:
"Too high!" if your guess is larger than the number.
"Too low!" if your guess is smaller.
"You got it!" when you guess right.
You have a limited number of tries, for example, 5 guesses per round.
After guessing right or running out of attempts, you can decide to:
Play another round.
Or see your final score
